#### Typescript Automatically Infer Variable Types
- We can just write a variable in Typescript file, it is smart enough to  **automatically infer** the type (*you can 
  see 
  that by
  hovering over the variable*)
```typescript jsx
import React from 'react'

let url = 'https://www.youtube.com' // (if you hover over *url* it will be of type *string*.
```
- This is the benefit of using **Typescript**. It's going to infer the **type** Even though we do not specify the type.


#### Specifying Types to Variables 
- Here are some examples to specify types
    - number
    - string 
    - boolean
    - array
```typescript jsx
let age: number = 18
let age: string = 'eighteen'
let isAdult: boolean = true
let ages: number[] = [23, 24, 26, 54]
```
- We can also use 'or' to declare two types
```typescript jsx
let age: number | string 
let ages: (number | string)[]
```
